Automate with Mistral
---------------------

Any backup strategy requires taking backups on regular basis
and it's good to have these repeatable actions automated.

Taking a drive backup is often considered as a single action but
usually requires taking a snapshot, taking a backup of the snapshot and
then deleting the snapshot. So taking a drive backup is actually a workflow.

Mistral is a workflow service for OpenStack cloud and the plugin provides a
sample Mistral workbook.

To use the sample you need your OpenStack environment deployed with
`Mistral Fuel plugin(TODO: URL) <>`__.
